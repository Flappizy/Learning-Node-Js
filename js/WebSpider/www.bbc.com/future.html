Chris Askew at the University of Surrey, UK, for example, showed eight-year-old children pictures of three unfamiliar Australian marsupials &ndash; the quoll, quokka, and cuscus, that were paired with either a photo of a frightened, a photo of a smiling face, or no photo at all. In follow up tests, they reported feeling more scared of those animals that had been paired with the frightened faces and were much more reluctant to open a box that reportedly contained the animal in question. And the effects were long lasting, with further tests revealing that they were more likely to associate fear-related words with those animals for months after the original exposure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESimply recognising a danger is often not enough to keep a child safe, however, since their developing brains may not be quick enough to react to the problem at hand.

These studies often take the form of gambling tasks. They might be given a multi-coloured spinner with an arrow in the middle, for instance. If the spinner lands on the correct colour, they have the chance of winning $10 (&pound;9) &ndash; but there is a 50% chance of not winning anything.

It's often simply a matter of the situations that they find themselves in. As they gain independence away from the watchful eyes of their parents, there are many more opportunities to act rashly &ndash; whether that's attempting to shoplift, trying an illegal drug, joining a gang, having unprotected sex, or racing their friends on the motorway. \"Access to risk-conducive situations increases dramatically during adolescence and during emerging adulthood,\" Defoe explains &ndash; and sometimes, it is hard to resist the temptations that brings.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20221101-how-to-teach-kids-to-make-great-choices-2"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p0ddjmkq"],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20221101-how-to-teach-kids-to-make-great-choices-3"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDecision-making competence \u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen trying to help a teen navigate their newfound freedom, it's worth remembering that there are considerable differences in risk appraisal between individuals at any age.

This includes questions that test someone's abilities to follow basic logical rules when weighing up the pros and cons of different options, as well as measures of common cognitive biases that might skew someone's understanding of risk. For example, it presents participants with two separate statements about condoms. One says:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EImagine that a type of condom has a 5% failure rate.

This is known as the \"framing bias\". If you show this kind of inconsistency in your answers, it suggests you may not be used to assessing statistical information critically and focusing on the specific details of what is being presented; instead, you just go with the gist based on the way it is presented, which can be misleading.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOther questions test the consistency of people's risk perception. The participants might be asked to guess their chances of dying within the next year, or within the next 10 years. Logically speaking, the probability given for the first question must be less than the second, since the risk of dying accumulates over time, but not everyone's answers reflect this. Once again, this may reflect a general inability to think logically about probabilities.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the participants are questioned on their general knowledge of common risks &ndash; and their confidence in their answers.

But getting scientific results isn't easy. If we just compare the thinking and behaviour of people who speak different languages, it's hard to be sure that any differences aren't down to culture, personality or something else entirely.&nbsp;The central role that language plays in expressing ourselves also makes it hard to unpick it from these other influences.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"gmail-p1\"\u003EThere are ways around this conundrum, however.

We know that people often use metaphors to think about abstract concepts &ndash; for example, a \"high price\", \"long time\" or \"deep mystery\".

The trick was that these events occurred at different rates. Monolingual Swedish speakers were easily misled when the line was shown &ndash; they believed a longer line meant more time had passed, even if that wasn't the case.

When the Swedish word for duration (\u003Cem\u003Etid\u003C\u002Fem\u003E) appeared in the top corner of the computer screen, the participants estimated time using line length and weren't affected by container volume.

For example, German, Chinese, Japanese, Dutch and the Scandinavian languages have no linguistic barrier between the present and the future, while \"futured languages\", such as English, French, Italian, Spanish and Greek, encourage speakers to view the future as something separate from the present.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"gmail-p2\"\u003EHe discovered that speakers of futureless languages were&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.aeaweb.org\u002Farticles?id=10.1257\u002Faer.103.2.690\"\u003Emore likely to engage\u003C\u002Fa\u003E&nbsp;in future-focused activities.

As if that wasn't enough, we also have to calculate which frame of reference they apply in. If someone tells you to pick up the keys on the right of a computer, do they mean on the computer's right-hand side or to the right of the computer from your perspective when facing it? The former is called an \"intrinsic\" reference frame (having two reference points: computer and keys) and the latter a \"relative\" reference frame (there are three reference points: computer, keys and observer).&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"gmail-p2\"\u003EAnd this can shape how we think &ndash; and navigate.

But a German speaker hesitated, looking slightly confused. When shown the path across the field, at the end of which there was a church, she finally concluded: \"Ah, so you mean we should walk towards the church?\" She needed a start and end point to picture the diagonal the sign was referring to.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"gmail-p2\"\u003EAs this body of research grows, it is becoming increasingly clear that language is influencing how we think about the world around us and our passage through it.

But we still end up with a substantive moral view. Altruism may not be the whole of morality, but it's surely part. We can meet our altruistic obligations, while respecting people's rights, by giving away part of what we have. And while there are limits to how much we are required to give &ndash;&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.givingwhatwecan.org\u002F\"\u003EEffective Altruists often urge a tithe of 10%\u003C\u002Fa\u003E &ndash;&nbsp;we should give what we can to the most effective causes, ones that have the biggest positive impact on aggregate happiness.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe attractions of this approach are evident: it is simple, pragmatic, and apparently backed by data. Effective Altruists devote considerable acumen to rating the effectiveness of different charities by measures such as \"quality-adjusted life years\" saved. For example, mosquito nets and malaria medicines save more lives per dollar than other charitable interventions. Effective Altruism offers a concrete vision of what to do instead of doomscrolling.

And who would plead for inefficient, wasteful giving?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese questions put the critic of Effective Altruism in an awkward spot. And yet the truth is that the movement doesn't really answer the question we began with: how should we respond to the injustice of the world? As its name suggests, the focus of Effective Altruism is on philanthropy, not justice. It's a theory of how to spend one's money and time as an individual, not how society should be organised or transformed.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20221102-injustice-is-everywhere-so-what-are-our-moral-duties-4"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p0dcbyds"],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20221102-injustice-is-everywhere-so-what-are-our-moral-duties-5"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EThe Effective Altruist's problem with justice shows up everywhere. For instance, when we measure the effectiveness of charities in terms of \"quality-adjusted life years\", we discount years of life impaired by disability, giving them less weight in our calculations. To do that in public policy or charitable giving is to treat the lives of disabled people as less worth saving than the lives of the able-bodied.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother issue is Effective Altruism's attitude to politics. The objection isn't just that political interventions, rather than charitable ones, might be a more effective means to greater aggregate happiness. It's about the division of moral labour. Imagine we carved the world into nation-states in order to discharge our altruistic obligations more efficiently, each state responsible for its own citizens. In that case, it would be double-counting to make citizens of one country take up the slack when another government fails. That doesn't mean we should do nothing, but our individual obligations would be limited, and might have more to do with political reform than direct intervention. Of course, the real world doesn't match this just-so story; the history of nation-states and their altruistic roles is more complex. But there's no way to assess the scale of our actual obligations, or how we should respond to them, without asking how the cartoon differs from reality &ndash; addressing questions of global politics Effective Altruists neglect.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the problem of justice shows up in how much of the harm we see in the world is collectively caused. When a Westerner looks at drought or famine in post-colonial countries, they can't ignore the history of colonial exploitation. And when they look at climate change, they can't ignore its human causes, or the fact that its harms will disproportionately burden those who are least responsible for it. Addressing such harms is not a matter of altruism &ndash; like helping the victims of a natural disaster far away &ndash; but a question of injustice and one's complicity in it.

I think we find one in the work of Iris Marion Young, a pioneering political theorist who died of cancer at the age of 57. Young developed the concept of \"structural injustice\" &ndash;&nbsp;injustice that is not localised in unjust attitudes or actions, but emerges interactively &ndash;&nbsp;and proposed a new model of responsibility to go with it. Effective Altruists treat all human needs alike, but we are more responsible for some than others. In short, our moral relation to human suffering is more urgent when we're caught up in its causes or effects.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYoung contends that we're responsible for structural injustice. At the root of her argument is a contrast between, on one side, culpability or blame, and on the other, responsibility for change. To take an example: while it's unfair to criticise present-day Americans for their nation's racist history, they are often implicated in systems that sustain its legacy now. Consider education. American cities are de facto segregated and since schools are supported by local taxes and Black communities are disproportionately poor, their schools are on average less well-funded than schools in wealthy neighbourhoods. Equality of educational opportunity is a myth.

That is a paralysing thought.\" But the proper response to paralysis is not inaction; it is to take the first step. Do one thing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELet me admit &ndash; or rather, insist &ndash; that I am not a model to emulate here. I have not done much: occasional marches and political campaigns, voting regularly, talking politics with friends. All good, but none of it likely to make much difference. Young confronts bystanders like me with \"the question of the agent of change\". It's not enough to identify injustice, nor to vote for politicians you prefer, who will often be indifferent or obstructive to the change you want to see; and it is typically futile to act alone. Our task is to find collective agents &ndash;&nbsp;movements, unions, interest groups &ndash; that have the power and will to make things happen.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not much of an activist, let alone a leader, and I feel routinely crushed by the injustice of the world. If that resonates with you, my advice is to pick a single issue &ndash; mass incarceration, poverty, voting, women's rights &ndash; and find a local group that you can join. For me, the issue was climate change and the group was Fossil Free MIT, whose 2014 campaign led to MIT's first Climate Action Plan. Since then, I've given talks about climate justice and addressed the issue online. Four years ago, I developed a class on the ethics of climate change with a colleague at MIT.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI am sure it's not enough, and I feel some guilt about the fact that I'm not doing more. You may share that guilty feeling, directed at the issues that disturb you most. Are we doing all we can to fight injustice? Who can say they do enough? Writing in the wake of World War Two, Adorno warned: \"Wrong life cannot be lived rightly.\" He meant that we cannot live well in conditions of injustice that sully every aspect of social life; we cannot even know what flourishing would be. But there is a more mundane truth in his aphorism.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20221102-injustice-is-everywhere-so-what-are-our-moral-duties-8"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p0dcbwnb"],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20221102-injustice-is-everywhere-so-what-are-our-moral-duties-9"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EWe know that there are limits to what we can ask of ourselves in \"living rightly\", given who we are. What we are capable of doing turns on our psychology and social circumstance, our partial grasp of the social world, the need to maintain our equilibrium. But though we know that we have limits, we don't know where those limits are. The result is that, when I ask myself whether I am doing enough to meet my responsibility for justice, it would be an awfully neat coincidence if the answer were yes. What are the odds that I've hit the mark precisely, the most I can expect of myself? Close to zero, I would think. The result is that I am virtually certain that I am falling short. Perhaps it's obvious that I am. But the same reasoning applies to almost anyone, even those who do much more, people whose lives are devoted to social change. Even lifelong activists can't be sure they've done enough. In conditions of widespread injustice, we are compelled to doubt that we are living well.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere's instruction and reassurance to be found in this. We shouldn't feel too bad that we feel bad: our guilt is not a mistake. More importantly, we shouldn't let it put us off, condemning our own efforts as too small. They may be small &ndash; but it's perverse to deal with that by throwing up our hands and doing less. There is value in a single step towards justice, and one step leads to another. While it's hard to make a difference on one's own, the march of millions is made up of individuals. Collective action exists at every scale, from local unions to protests and political campaigns.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EConfronted with the scope of human misery, some despair: \"It doesn't matter what I do,\" they say, \"since millions will still suffer.\" But this thought is confused.

As we can&rsquo;t predict exactly how many readers will click on the story before we publish it, we use a per-pageview emissions estimate, which is the same for all stories. We got this figure using a test story, calculating emissions as above and then dividing that by the pageviews that the test story actually had over six months. That gives us a better estimate than just plugging in the URL from a story to the agency&rsquo;s standard carbon calculator, because for a story where the number of pageviews is a weighty factor in the equation, using data on actual pageviews makes it more accurate.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe story we used as a test to get this figure was a BBC Future story, and we used the actual number of pageviews it had over a six-month period. Factors such as how many images a page has and the length of the story can make a big difference in the energy required to load the page, and how long the reader spends on the page. Our stories vary in length and number of images, so it&rsquo;s important to stress that this figure is an estimate, not a precise measurement.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20200131-why-and-how-does-future-planet-count-carbon-2"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":[],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20200131-why-and-how-does-future-planet-count-carbon-3"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EHere are some other inherent unknowns we had to contend with:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EThe device that a reader accesses the story on can make a big difference to the energy used.

The carbon intensity of the energy grid varies between countries. The calculation assumed the average intensity as reported by the International Energy Agency (475g CO2-equivalent per kWh). But in reality, this will vary based on where readers are in the world.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFuture Planet does not reside on any single server, and the BBC has servers in multiple datacentres. The BBC also uses Content Delivery Networks, third-party networks of servers that reduce the load on our own. The calculation doesn&rsquo;t take account of this, which slightly inflates the estimate as CDNs are more efficient.\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe cumulative uncertainty from these factors is the reason we show the digital component of emissions as a range, rather than a single figure.

Similarly, we can&rsquo;t yet measure for a given click exactly how much carbon is released from the transfer of that exact data over the internet, the energy to run those specific servers at any instant, or which type of device a reader is using when they make that click.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are other factors that some might argue should be counted in a story&rsquo;s carbon emissions, too. What about the BBC staff who work on Future Planet, some full-time but many sporadically among other obligations &ndash; do we count, for example, the energy used to heat and power the office? If we do, should we count the carbon emissions from the large number of energy-hungry servers housed in the building, or is that irrelevant as they don&rsquo;t host Future Planet? Or you could take it even further: if a journalist ate a sandwich while on location reporting for us, do we count the carbon footprint of the food &ndash; or not, since they&rsquo;d likely have to eat regardless of whether they were on assignment?
