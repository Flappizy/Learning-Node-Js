<p>Ousmane Dembele and Frenkie de Jong chipped in with the goals but all the attention was on Pique, who looked like the iconic defender of the old days in his 85-minute display.</p>
<p>He was sound on the ball as ever and strong when it came to protecting the Barcelona goal. The home fans got their opportunity to show their gratitude to the man who has given so much to the club over the years.</p>
<p>"Gerard leaves a spectacular legacy," said Sergio Busquets after the match. "He has become [synonymous] with one of the best clubs in the world. He has made history. He has gone out of his way for the club. He has created an incredible atmosphere. He is the example of what a Barca player is and what he has to do."</p>
<p>The win was not as easy as it should have been for Xavi's men, however. </p>
<p>Robert Lewandowski missed an early penalty and Fernando Martinez was a rock in goal for the visitors, but goals were imminent amid Barcelona's dominant display and they eventually came in the second half.</p>
<p>The Catalan side are on a four-game winning run in La Liga now and go top of the table at least temporarily ahead of Real Madrid's trip to Rayo Vallecano.</p><div class="widget-inline-editors-picks clearfix"> <h3>Editors&#039; Picks</h3> <ul>  <li> <a href="/en-ng/lists/power-ranking-africa-s-world-cup-coaches/blta819b686a48ee0b0" title="Power Ranking Africa’s World Cup coaches"> Power Ranking Africa’s World Cup coaches </a> </li>  <li> <a href="/en-ng/lists/England-2022-world-cup-squad-qatar/bltbf7b1b2ff75494bd" title="England World Cup 2022 squad: Who&#039;s in and who&#039;s out?"> England World Cup 2022 squad: Who&#039;s in and who&#039;s out? </a> </li>  <li> <a href="/en-ng/news/aribo-what-is-in-store-for-southampton-and-nigeria-star-after-jones-appointment/blt0b077742021d4bb9" title="Aribo: What is in store for Southampton and Nigeria star after Jones’ appointment?"> Aribo: What is in store for Southampton and Nigeria star after Jones’ appointment? </a> </li>  <li> <a href="/en-ng/lists/germany-2022-world-cup-squad-thomas-muller-antonio-rudiger-qatar/blt5b994b70cd9ceb3c" title="Germany World Cup 2022 squad: Who&#039;s in and who&#039;s out?"> Germany World Cup 2022 squad: Who&#039;s in and who&#039;s out? </a> </li>  </ul> </div> </div>  <div class="widget-slide-list"> <ul class="widget-slide-list__list">  <li class="widget-slide-list__item" id="cs5a606de21028fd5a"> <div class="widget-slide-list__image">  <img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blte3046aa9c3287466/6366c951f8082b4fb7d395a8/GettyImages-1244525240.jpg?auto=webp&amp;format=jpg&amp;quality=60&amp;width=400" width="" height="" alt="Gerard Pique Barcelona 2022-23"/> <div class="widget-slide-list__image-source" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" title="Getty"> <span itemprop="name">Getty</span> </div>  </div> <div class="widget-slide-list__content"> <h2 class="widget-slide-list__title">  The Winners </h2> <div class="widget-slide-list__body"> <p><strong>Gerard Pique:</strong></p><p>Showed why Barcelona have adored him for so long. He was good on the ball throughout the first half with some nice passes to help create chances while he was strong defensively to ensure Almeria could not get through to threaten Marc-Andre ter Stegen. He got the send off he deserved as he exited the field after 84 minutes - with his team-mates hugging him and the crowd chanting his name. It brought tears to many eyes!</p><p><strong>Frenkie de Jong:</strong></p><p>He played as more of an attacking midfielder for the majority of the game before dropping deeper later in the second half. Despite a bad pass that left his team under pressure and some fouls in the first period, De Jong looked excellent on the ball. He pulled off some much better passes as the match progressed, caused danger going forwards just before half-time and then chipped in with the second goal. </p><p><strong>Fernando Martinez: </strong></p><p>He may have conceded two goals at Camp Nou but the Almeria goalkeeper gave a good account of himself in this game. He made some strong saves to deny and frustrate the home team, who were dominant throughout. Given how frequently he was under pressure against such a star-filled attack, it was only a matter of time before he conceded but the beating would have been much worse with another man between the posts.</p> </div> </div> </li>  <li class="widget-slide-list__item" id="cs707c560e2b6b8910"> <div class="widget-slide-list__image">  <img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blt1187e460aa4235ef/6366da5320763110cfeafea6/GettyImages-1244527511.jpg?auto=webp&amp;format=jpg&amp;quality=60&amp;width=400" width="" height="" alt="Ferran Torres Barcelona Almeria 2022-23"/> <div class="widget-slide-list__image-source" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" title="Getty"> <span itemprop="name">Getty</span> </div>  </div> <div class="widget-slide-list__content"> <h2 class="widget-slide-list__title">  The Losers </h2> <div class="widget-slide-list__body"> <p><strong>Ferran Torres:</strong></p><p>You can't fault him for his effort. The attacker was the main attacking threat for Barcelona throughout the first half but was unable to make the decisive action to get on the scoresheet. He had to be replaced by Ansu Fati, who was an immediate game-changer. Torres was not bad but hardly made a convincing argument for a regular place in the starting XI in this game.</p><p><strong>Robert Lewandowski:</strong></p><p>Possibly his most disappointing performance in La Liga this season. His penalty miss was atrocious and left fans wishing he had given Pique the chance to get a goal in his final match at Camp Nou. After that, he was very quiet.</p><p><strong>Rubi and Kaiky:</strong></p><p>Kaiky is<span> how old?! The 18-year-old had a rough start as his handball gave away a penalty just five minutes in, but he recovered from that scare incredibly well. He made a vital clearance to deny Ferran Torres and overall looked strong in the Almeria back line. Unfortunately, Rubi took him off </span>at half-time, and the Almeria defence fell apart as a result. The teenager was deprived of the opportunity to really impress in such a big game and prove he is destined to play at a higher level while Almeria were left without a hope for the second period.</p> </div> </div> </li>  <li class="widget-slide-list__item" id="csa0cce57b1ca6d642"> <div class="widget-slide-list__image">  <img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/bltb6add9f0f5b5fed9/6366db125ce1a54e6e3f782a/GettyImages-1244525850.jpg?auto=webp&amp;format=jpg&amp;quality=60&amp;width=400" width="" height="" alt="Jordi Alba Barcelona Almeria 2022-23"/> <div class="widget-slide-list__image-source" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" title="Getty"> <span itemprop="name">Getty</span> </div>  </div> <div class="widget-slide-list__content"> <h2 class="widget-slide-list__title">  Barcelona Ratings: Defence </h2> <div class="widget-slide-list__body"> <p><strong>Marc-Andre ter Stegen (6/10): </strong></p><p>Had nothing to do until the 28th minute when he came out and stop Largie Ramazani in a one-on-one and did very well to keep the Almeria attacker out, rescuing his defence from conceding through a horrible mistake.</p><p><strong>Alejandro Balde (7/10):</strong></p><p>Got forward a lot throughout the game and was eager to get the ball into the box but surrendered it too easily to Gonzalo Melero inside the area near the end of the first half to put his team under pressure.</p><p><strong>Gerard Pique (8/10):</strong></p><p>The Spanish icon played his last ever match in front of the Camp Nou crowd and looked excellent.
