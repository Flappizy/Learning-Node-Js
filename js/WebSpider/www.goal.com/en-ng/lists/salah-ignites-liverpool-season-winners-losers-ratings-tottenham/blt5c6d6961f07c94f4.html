The Reds have their first away win of the league campaign, and a huge one too, as Mohamed Salah’s first-half brace saw them beat rivals Tottenham on a day when defeat may well have spelt the end of their hopes of a top-four finish.</p>
<p>Instead, Jurgen Klopp’s side move to within seven points of Spurs, who occupy fourth spot. Liverpool also have a game in hand, and had been buoyed earlier in the day by defeats for fellow Champions League hopefuls Chelsea and Manchester United.</p>
<p>Most importantly for Klopp were signs that the spirit and courage of his side, questioned regularly during the opening weeks of the campaign, is starting to return. Salah’s brilliance gave them control of the game, but they had to dig deep after half-time, and were hanging on at times after Harry Kane reduced the deficit 20 minutes from the end.</p>
<p>Hang on they did, though, and they know a win at home to struggling Southampton next week would ensure a far more positive mood at Anfield heading into the break for the World Cup.</p>
<p>Light at the end of the tunnel? Maybe, just maybe.</p><div class="widget-inline-editors-picks clearfix"> <h3>Editors&#039; Picks</h3> <ul>  <li> <a href="/en-ng/lists/power-ranking-africa-s-world-cup-coaches/blta819b686a48ee0b0" title="Power Ranking Africa’s World Cup coaches"> Power Ranking Africa’s World Cup coaches </a> </li>  <li> <a href="/en-ng/lists/England-2022-world-cup-squad-qatar/bltbf7b1b2ff75494bd" title="England World Cup 2022 squad: Who&#039;s in and who&#039;s out?"> England World Cup 2022 squad: Who&#039;s in and who&#039;s out? </a> </li>  <li> <a href="/en-ng/news/aribo-what-is-in-store-for-southampton-and-nigeria-star-after-jones-appointment/blt0b077742021d4bb9" title="Aribo: What is in store for Southampton and Nigeria star after Jones’ appointment?"> Aribo: What is in store for Southampton and Nigeria star after Jones’ appointment? </a> </li>  <li> <a href="/en-ng/lists/germany-2022-world-cup-squad-thomas-muller-antonio-rudiger-qatar/blt5b994b70cd9ceb3c" title="Germany World Cup 2022 squad: Who&#039;s in and who&#039;s out?"> Germany World Cup 2022 squad: Who&#039;s in and who&#039;s out? </a> </li>  </ul> </div> </div>  <div class="widget-slide-list"> <ul class="widget-slide-list__list">  <li class="widget-slide-list__item" id="cs5a606de21028fd5a"> <div class="widget-slide-list__image">  <img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blta4b21e56594d1259/636804f393215e112b37f73d/Ibrahima_Konate_Liverpool_2022-23.jpg?auto=webp&amp;format=jpg&amp;quality=60&amp;width=400" width="" height="" alt="Ibrahima Konate Liverpool 2022-23"/> <div class="widget-slide-list__image-source" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" title="Getty Images"> <span itemprop="name">Getty Images</span> </div>  </div> <div class="widget-slide-list__content"> <h2 class="widget-slide-list__title">  The Winners </h2> <div class="widget-slide-list__body"> <p><strong>Mohamed Salah: </strong></p><p>How's that for a big contribution in a big game? When Liverpool needed a hero, the man who delivers so often for them delivered again. Salah's first-half double, both goals clinically taken, gave Klopp's side a lead they would hold on to for dear life, and showed, once again, why the Egyptian is still the Reds' best and most decisive player. He has 14 goals in all competitions this season, and he had ice in his veins as he twice left Hugo Lloris and the Spurs defence stranded before half-time. His first was an instinctive strike from Darwin Nunez's pass, fired low and hard before the goalkeeper could react. His second was a lovely dinked finish, after Eric Dier had made a pig's ear of a back header. And throughout, there were moments of pure class as the 30-year-old continually bought his side time and got them up the field when the pressure was mounting. He might have completed his hat-trick, but didn't get hold of an effort from another Nunez pass. By the time he was replaced in stoppage time by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, the away end was singing his name. No wonder. Mohamed Salah, Liverpool's match-winner, again. </p><p><strong>Darwin Nunez: </strong></p><p>Another game, another perfect encapsulation of why Liverpool fans have fallen in love with their new £64m ($72m) centre-forward. Nunez didn't actually play as a centre-forward here. Not to begin with, anyway. He started out on the left, and it looked an inspired call by Jurgen Klopp as the Uruguayan tore into Spurs from the first whistle. He tested Lloris with a stinging volley inside three minutes, curled another effort just wide soon after before setting up Salah for the opener with an astute pass having gathered Andy Robertson's low cross. Nunez created another chance for Salah after the break and finished, again, having taken more shots than anyone else on the field. He didn't score this time, but boy did he graft for his team, popping up at left back and right wing, competing for everything and showing plenty of quality. He earned his hug from Klopp, and his ovation from the travelling Kop.</p><p><strong>Ibrahima Konate:</strong></p><p>How different could Liverpool's season look had Konate not damaged his knee on the eve of the campaign? The Frenchman is making a huge difference to Klopp's defence, and he was immense again here, delivering a mammoth performance alongside Virgil van Dijk as the Reds protected their precious advantage in the second half. Konate's pace and strength make him a huge asset next to Trent Alexander-Arnold, who was targeted relentlessly by Spurs' switches of play, but it was the 23-year-old's positional play which stood out here. Time and again, he was in the right place at the right time. He made twice as many clearances as anyone else on the field, and won possession back more times than any other Liverpool player. Tottenham tested him, but even in stoppage time there he was, stretching at the near post to get a vital touch to yet another left-wing delivery. He probably won't be at the World Cup, which is a shame given his quality, but Liverpool will be glad to wrap him in cotton wool while the rest go through the ringer in Qatar. Konate is Van Dijk's partner, now and in the future.</p> </div> </div> </li>  <li class="widget-slide-list__item" id="cs707c560e2b6b8910"> <div class="widget-slide-list__image">  <img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blte0d163b51860ad6c/636805316ece585078fdc31a/Eric_Dier_Tottenham_2022-23.jpg?auto=webp&amp;format=jpg&amp;quality=60&amp;width=400" width="" height="" alt="Eric Dier Tottenham 2022-23"/> <div class="widget-slide-list__image-source" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" title="Getty Images"> <span itemprop="name">Getty Images</span> </div>  </div> <div class="widget-slide-list__content"> <h2 class="widget-slide-list__title">  The Losers </h2> <div class="widget-slide-list__body"> <p><strong>Eric Dier:</strong></p><p>Oh dear, Dier. What was he thinking? There was little danger as Alisson Becker launched a long, straight clearance right onto the head of Tottenham's right-sided centre-back, but the England international made an absolute mess of his attempted back-header, and with Salah about that is a fatal error to make. Dier did try to make amends thereafter, stepping forward regularly after half-time, but when he got his head on Ivan Perisic's corner, Alisson was equal to it, and the Liverpool goalkeeper then turned over the Spurs man's mis-hit cross. Thursday sees the announcement of Gareth Southgate's 26-man squad for the World Cup. Dier will be in it, but whether that says more about him or the dearth of centre-back options at England's disposal, we'll leave for you to judge...</p><p><strong>Emerson Royal:</strong></p><p>Dier wasn't the only Spurs man to have a nightmare on the day, with Emerson Royal targeted by the home fans after delivering a haphazard performance at right wing back. His substitution for Matt Doherty, midway through the second half, drew the loudest cheers of the day to that point. Moments earlier, the Brazilian had horrendously overhit an attempted cross from wide on the right, which kind of summed up his afternoon. It is hard to imagine he'll be starting against Leeds next week.</p> </div> </div> </li>  <li class="widget-slide-list__item" id="csa0cce57b1ca6d642"> <div class="widget-slide-list__image">  <img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/bltf2b153ed75a8ef60/63680566f733eb4a524d0626/Virgil_van_Dijk_Liverpool_2022-23.jpg?auto=webp&amp;format=jpg&amp;quality=60&amp;width=400" width="" height="" alt="Virgil van Dijk Liverpool 2022-23"/> <div class="widget-slide-list__image-source" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization" title="Getty Images"> <span itemprop="name">Getty Images</span> </div>  </div> <div class="widget-slide-list__content"> <h2 class="widget-slide-list__title">  Liverpool Ratings: Defence </h2> <div class="widget-slide-list__body"> <p><strong>Alisson Becker (7/10): </strong></p><p>Got away with one spill from Hojbjerg in the first half.
