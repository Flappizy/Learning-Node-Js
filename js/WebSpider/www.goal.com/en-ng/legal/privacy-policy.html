How & why we use the data we collect</strong></p><p>We use the User Information for three main purposes: (i) to operate and improve the platforms and to ensure that we can provide the Services; (ii) to optimise the content on the platforms and enhance your experience of the Services; and (iii) send marketing and show advertising to our users.</p><p></p><p>More specifically, we will use the User Information to do one or more of the following things:<br/><br/></p><ol><li>administer our platforms;</li><li>provide the Service requested by the user;</li><li>improve the browsing experience by personalising the Service to the user;</li><li>recommend goods, services or promotions which may be of interest to the user or contact users in order to conduct market research (with the consent of the user, where necessary). For these purposes, we may conduct research on our users’ demographics, interests and behaviour, including performing statistical analysis of our users, their use of the Services, and their purchasing patterns. We do this to optimise and improve the Services, our products, and our operations and we will create a profile about your interests and preferences which will enable us to increase our advertising and communication relevance;</li><li>prevent, detect and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities, including fraud, cheating, and money laundering and enforce our terms;</li><li>to notify users about changes to our Service;</li><li>send out email alerts, text message notifications or device notifications in relation to our Service;</li><li>send users prizes won via the platforms, and supply services purchased via our platforms;&nbsp;</li><li>send notices and invoices to users, and collect payments from them;&nbsp;</li><li>provide third parties with statistical and other information about our users as required to operate the platforms or Services;</li><li>deal with enquiries and complaints;&nbsp;</li><li>provide our commercial partners with information about users’ use of co-branded services, including historical use data;&nbsp;</li><li>comply with any legal or regulatory requirements and otherwise respond to any relevant regulator or competent authority as required by law;&nbsp;</li><li>understand user trends and patterns; and</li><li>develop aggregate analysis in respect of our users and business intelligence that enables us to operate, protect, make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business.</li></ol><p>The platforms we operate are designed to attract as many users as possible.&nbsp; In our case, our users are typically sports fans or interested in sports news and other sports-related content.&nbsp; The creation of this content, and the work that goes into ensuring that the platforms continue to be class-leading digital sports destinations, are funded by advertising revenues which we receive as a result of showing users advertising or other sponsored or branded content on the platforms.&nbsp; We have a legitimate interest in ensuring that we deliver this advertising in a responsible way, and in allowing us to deliver it to the users most likely to be interested in it, and in doing so we employ User Information, such as the user's location, how the user engages with the platforms and the content that the user views.<br/><br/></p><p>More specifically, in relation to advertising:</p><ul><li>we employ User Information to select and deliver advertising that appears on our platforms, and to allow third parties (such as ad servers) to do this on our behalf;</li><li>we employ User Information to select and deliver advertising to users based on the way the user has interacted with our platforms, and to share that information with third parties to allow them to do so;&nbsp;</li><li>we may pass User Information to service providers, such as Oracle or Google, to allow them to provide services on our behalf or to partner with us in selecting and serving ads for our advertising partners;</li><li>we may pass User Information to advertisers or third-party publishers to allow us to report on the advertising displayed to our users and how users interacted with it; and</li><li>we will not employ User Information to make qualitative judgments about individual users, nor make automated decisions in relation to users which could have a significant or legal effect on them, nor will we knowingly engage any third party to do so.</li></ul><p><u><strong>4. Cookies</strong></u></p><p>Much of the User Information that we collect, and most of the information we employ in connection with advertising, is obtained via the use of cookies and similar technologies.&nbsp; Cookies are usually a string of numbers and/or letters that a platform transfers to a user's hard drive.

It will include any information from which you can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as your name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or other information about your identity. Most User Information will constitute personal data.<br/><br/></p><p><u><strong>Who is responsible for your personal data?</strong></u></p><p>If you use our Service, the Data Controller is:</p><p>Football Co Media Limited</p><p>72 Dean Street</p><p>London</p><p>W1D 3SG<br/><br/></p><p>FootballCo Media Limited is registered as a data controller with the Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK (registration number ZA828085).<br/><br/></p><p><u><strong>What is the legal basis on which we rely to process your personal data?</strong></u></p><p>On some occasions, we process your personal data with your consent (for example, when you agree to participate in our surveys and other activities or when you give us consent to send you marketing communications (adopting a “double-opt-in” where required) or to deal with your enquiries, as set out in paragraph 3 (d).</p><p>On other occasions, we process your personal data when we need to do this in order to fulfil a contract with you (for example, to make available to you the requested content or for billing purposes) or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract (for example, verifying your information), as set out in paragraph 3 letters (a), (b), (c), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k).&nbsp;</p><p>We also process your personal data when it is in our legitimate interests to do this and when these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights, as set out in paragraph 3 letters (c), (e), (j), (k), (l), (n) and (o). For example, we may process your personal data in our legitimate interests to ensure that the platforms and Services are provided efficiently and in an user-friendly and personalised manner taking into account user feedback, data and profiles, unless consent is required for any such processing under applicable law. We will process personal data to ensure the security of our business and the information of our users, and to ensure the proper and efficient administration of our business.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we will process your personal data where we are required to do this by law (for example, where we have to fulfil anti-money laundering requirements or disclose information under a court order), as set out in paragraph 3 letters (f), (g), (k) and (m).<br/><br/>&nbsp;</p><p><u><strong>How long do we keep data?</strong></u></p><p>We keep your data for only as long as required to provide you with the necessary Services and to carry out the processing set out in this notice, and in line with its obligation under applicable law. This means that we will generally not keep your personal information for longer than six years following your last interaction with us, and the retention period will often be shorter. For example, we may keep your information for marketing purposes for a period of 3 years following the termination or expiry of our relationship, or your last contact with us.<br/><br/></p><p><u><strong>Your rights</strong></u></p><p>Data subjects may ask us for a copy of their information, to correct it, erase it or to transfer it to other organisations at their request. Data subjects also have rights to object to some processing including profiling and, where we have asked for their consent to process the data subject’s data, to withdraw this consent. In particular, data subjects have the right to object to direct marketing at any time. Where a data subject withdraws their consent, this will not affect the legitimacy of the processing conducted prior to your request.&nbsp; Where we process data because we have a legitimate interest in doing so (as explained above), the data subject has a right to object to this. Where we make a decision based solely on automated processing which significantly affects the data subject, he or she may have the right to contest the decision, express his or her point of view and obtain human intervention.&nbsp;</p><p>These rights may be limited in some situations – for example, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your data.<br/><br/></p><p>Please use the contact information set out in our Contact section above.<br/><br/></p><p>We hope that we can satisfy queries you may have about the way we process your data. However, if you have unresolved concerns you also have the right to complain to your local data protection authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br/><br/> </div> </div>  </div> <div class="widget-footer"> <a href="/en-ng" class="widget-footer__logo"> <img src="/assets/low-end/ltr/img/logo/light-lowend-header.d1d7448b47.png" alt="GOAL.com" /> </a> <div class="widget-footer__links">  <div><a href="/en-ng/contact">Contact Us</a></div> <div><a href="/en-ng/legal/terms-conditions">Terms of Service</a></div> <div><a href="/en-ng/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a></div>  </div> <p class="widget-footer__copyright">Copyright © 2022 <a href="/en-ng">Goal (Nigeria)</a> All rights reserved.
